# Apache + DNS boilerplate using Terraform

## Description
A personal sandbox-ish repo for me to better understand [IaC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) using [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform) together with [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) as my provider (over other resources like AWS).
This project allows you to provision 1 droplet with an Apache HTTP web server and then links your domain name into your DO DNS settings.

## Project Structure
Uses simple structure over complex, because this project is relatively simple and the target audience is basically non existant. lol.

## Contributing
